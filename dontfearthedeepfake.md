## Don't Fear the Deepfake

Let's do a little tabletop exercise. Imagine this scenario: 

**_You're a founder and CEO of a fast-growing company--something in fintech, say, or medtech, or edtech, or no-prefix tech; it doesn't really matter. Late on a Friday, you discover a monumental oversight, one that will have devastating effects on your bottom line if uncorrected, so thank god you discovered it just in time. A transfer of funds that was supposed to lock down a highly valuable client--one that you've staked a lot on--never went through, and you're about to lose 35% of next quarter's projected earnings._**

**_You call up the CFO (thanking god again that they're available for a Zoom) and explain the situation. You both agree  that there's no time to lose. Somebody has to send that wire, and it's gotta be somebody you can trust to keep it on the DL; you can't afford to let word of this get back to investors._**

**_You shoot an email to a very trusted employee asking if they can hop into a Zoom call right now, apologizing for pulling them into something right before the weekend, but letting them know it's urgent and they're the only one you can trust. They get into the call, you and your CFO explain what's going on, how you're on the precipice of disaster, how if this transfer doesn't go through layoffs are a near certainty, or worse._**

**_You explain that all you need them to do is send the funds today, before the weekend, and that this call can fill in for the formal approval process. You'll debrief on Monday to figure out where this all went wrong._**

In this situation, what would you want your employee to do?

You'd want them to tell you to fuck off.  Or maybe just hang up and don't say anything at all. You'd want them to ignore your pleas, your cajoling, your explanation of the very real situation you're all facing. You'd want them to ignore the threats to the company, the threats to their job, the threats to their coworkers' jobs. 

If they didn't, if they took you seriously even for a second, that means you have failed. As a manager, as a leader, and as an executive.

I'm a security researcher. I research deepfakes, and I've even made a few myself. They are tremendously easy to make; on my three-year-old gaming laptop I can make a decent-looking deepfake overnight, and with cloud computing I can make one in an hour for cheap. Hell, I could make four with the same amount of money it takes to buy [a pound of tootsie rolls.](https://www.amazon.com/Individually-Chocolate-Hampton-Popcorn-Company/dp/B0CHWN53YL?crid=152NMI39CUHMA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xWRETUy6Wdu-vnO8tOKQPsKQCkefZg5tDr91Navd4NpJqAZwn2bCp8Eu1E_wA9NIlR0hZWNmXt7seHKod6OUJHQUEdSWq0hu81fAHIezsxA1ebGvAZIhEqV4-QOrkXR3ZZ8BKlXstg8RAAA1HmmPIzoTVye94SmmKUc0x_nyIUQZSaQyNUZk-hiw7Q3vpF5pnl2Nu4SxkaVA8LBCQj3HJ8NNYuWGfUpsZe89e-AXAGOubwe8rHLlGz6oRtY3egKxbbrvvNhlRGSIRJmPLnp2jF_s8_KHzDxeidL7tmApSis.sx5HxdgWi1MTkeD6utZZZRgkrz7KfKHtqgriZhabIz0&dib_tag=se&sprefix=tootsie%2Br%2Caps%2C752)  Real-time deepfakes (that is, deepfakes where the faker can respond and react to the victim without dropping the disguise) are very much improving (Frankovitz et al.) while deepfake detection is always half a step behind
